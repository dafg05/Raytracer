In the previous parts of the ray tracer project, I had some bugs/missing parts that I had to fix to get this part to work.

1. In Transformations.java, my rotation matrix had a missing 1.
2. In Canvas.java, I messed up orientation of the toPpm() method.
3. In World.java, I had not created my custom world setup.

Some other parts of my previous code might have been slightly changed for consistency's sake.
